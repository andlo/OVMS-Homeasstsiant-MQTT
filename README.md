# Purpose

This integration aims to make it easier for people with the [OVMS module](https://www.openvehicles.com/)  to obtain all the MQTT values automatically, and create sensors in Home Assistant on the fly.

# Work in progress!

Please note that this integration is very much WIP, and not released yet.
